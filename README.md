# RULES

- The game has 2 players, playing in turns
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes and each result is added to his (or her) round score
- But, if the player rolls a 1, he (or she) loses his round score and after that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold' his score at any point during his turn and take home the points he (or she) has accumulated in that round adding to the total score
- After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 point total wins the game
